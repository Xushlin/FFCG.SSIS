# Forefront Consulting Group Sql Server Integration Services Tools

Wrappers for SQL queries to the SSIS database.

## Introduction
This is a simple WCF service wrapper for a few of the operations that the SSIS database exposes.
To avoid linking SSIS dll's the service connects to the database and calls stored procedures.

It accesses views in the SSISDB.catalog schema, but does not write anything except through stored procedures.

It is under development and currently exposes basic functionality for listing, running and checking packages.

## API
The service exposes the following methods.

### ExecutePackage

### GetPackage
Get package information for a single package.

### ListPackages
Lists packages in a project.

### ListOperations
Lists operations that are running / have run for a package.

### GetOperation

### ListOperationMessages

### ListFolders
Lists all folders.

### GetFolder
